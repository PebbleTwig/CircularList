I expected to spend around 3 to 4 hours on this project, and in actuality I spent about that much.

One of the hardest things for me and what I wasted a ton of time on was trying to reinvent the wheel,
and creating all of the code from scratch for the list. I also made some dumb mistakes, like trying to do
Node<E> head = new Node<E>(null);, and wondering why I was getting NullPointerExceptions. Eventually I figured it out
and made it Node<E> head = null;. Once I realized that I could use my old code from the DoublyLikedList, it
was much much easier.

Most of the problems I faced was with making the add method work before I fixed the code and reused some of the old code.
Once I had done that, it was only a matter of making the DoublyLinkedList work for a CircularList, which was not
as difficult as I was expecting. I did add a tail which I do not think I was supposed to do but it made adding
new nodes to the end of the list much easier, so that is why I did it. Most of the methods were easy to do and
figure out once I had the core methods done, like get, add, and remove, since some of the other methods could use these
methods to assist them in what they were trying to do.

As said in class most of the trouble was keeping track of all of the pointers, but once I had that down the rest wasn't
too much trouble.
